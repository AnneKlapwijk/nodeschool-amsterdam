					<h4>We're excited to bring NodeSchool to Node.js Interactive Europe!</h4>
					<br>
					<p>NodeSchool is a community-driven effort with hundreds of local chapters throughout the world that aim to teach essential programming skills. NodeSchool organizes in-person workshops and builds on an open source curriculum that teaches various Node.js and JavaScript skills in an interactive, self-guided format.</p>
					<p>
						Join your fellow attendees in one of the sessions and have the friendly organizers of NodeSchool Amsterdam and other members of the NodeSchool and Node.js communities help you through the sessions. There are many workshoppers (open source lesson modules) available for many skill levels â€” this instance we'll be focussing on some in-depth JavaScript and Node.js topics.
