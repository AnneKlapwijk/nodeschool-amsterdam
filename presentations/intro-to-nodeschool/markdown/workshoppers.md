## What is Node.js?

With Node.js you can use the very popular programming language JavaScript to write software. JavaScript is usually used in a browser, but combined with other tools, Node.js allows you to write server applications, mobile applications or even desktop applications.<!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->

Note:
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.


## Workshop format

<p class="fragment">NodeSchool workshops are <strong>hands-on</strong>. We use self guided tutorials, or <strong>workshoppers</strong>, as lesson modules. They are made up of <strong>challenges of increasing difficulty</strong> and we have <strong>40+ workshoppers</strong> to choose from.</p>

Note:
- choose-your-own-adventure style
- workshoppers work offline too
- working on your own project is fine


## Selecting a workshopper

<p class="fragment"><strong>Core</strong> workshoppers focus on essential skills for working with Node.js. If you&rsquo;re new to JavaScript and Node.js, pick these.</p>
<p class="fragment"><strong>Electives</strong> deal with more advanced topics. Pick one of these if you already have some experience.</p>


## Core workshoppers

If you want to learn some basic programming skills using JavaScript and Node.js, we recommend you start with one of these workshoppers:

<pre><code>
$ npm install -g javascripting

$ npm install -g learnyounode

</code></pre>

Note:
- We have tested these workshoppers on Node LTS (MacOS and Windows) and they are great for beginners.
- javascripting: learn the basics of JavaScript
- learnyounode: learn the basics of Node.js


## Recommended electives

If you want to challenge yourself by selecting an elective, we recommend the following workshopper:

<pre><code>
$ npm install -g functional-javascript-workshop

</code></pre>

Note:
- Also tested on Node LTS (MacOS and Windows)
- This workshoppers is great for people who already have some experience with JavaScript
- The challenges get increasingly difficult; interesting trampoline challenge for example


## 💀 electives

If you want to challenge yourself even more, we challenge you with the following workshoppers:

<pre><code>$ npm install -g learn-generators

$ npm install -g esnext-generation

$ npm install -g bacon-love

$ npm install -g shader-school</code></pre>

Note:
- We haven't tested these workshoppers, so we can't guarantee they work on all systems / Node versions


## How to get started

The basic workflow of a workshopper will look like this:

<pre><code>$ npm install -g learnyounode

$ learnyounode

$ learnyounode run program.js

$ learnyounode verify program.js

$ learnyounode print</code></pre>
