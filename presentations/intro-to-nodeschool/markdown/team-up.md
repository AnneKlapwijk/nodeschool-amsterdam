## Before you start&hellip;

Pick any workshopper you&rsquo;re interested in. Feel free to work on your own or to team up with others. If you need help setting up or have any other question, raise your hand and our mentors will help you out.<!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->

Note:
- You can perfectly do a workshopper on your own, but you can optionally team up with someone else. We actually recommend it, as it's more fun and you'll learn a lot more. Don't feel like it? That's cool too!
