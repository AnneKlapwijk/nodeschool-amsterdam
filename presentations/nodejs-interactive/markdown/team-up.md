Note:
- Who needs help with setting up? Raise your hand. Please go to ... <point to mentor(s)> and we'll get you up and running.
- You can perfectly do a workshopper on your own, but you can optionally team up with someone else. We actually recommend it, as it's more fun and you'll learn a lot more. Don't feel like it? That's cool too!
- If you have a question or have a hard time getting thru an exercise, let us know by raising your hand and one of the mentors will come up to you.
