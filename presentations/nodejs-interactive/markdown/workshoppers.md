## Workshop format

<p class="fragment">We use self-guided tutorials, or <strong>workshoppers</strong>, as lesson modules. You can do them on your own, but we encourage you to work together.</p>

Note:
- `no text` How do we organize our workshops?
- `text` We use an open source curriculum based on workshoppers, or self-guided lesson modules
- You can do them on your own (you don't actually need to attend a workshop to do one) and most work offline.


## Selecting a workshopper

<p class="fragment"><strong>Core</strong> workshoppers are focussed on essential skills for working with Node.js.</p>
<p class="fragment"><strong>Electives</strong> deal with more advanced topics and are more challenging to do.</p>

Note:
- 2 types/categories of workshoppers
- We recommend *Core* to people new to JavaScript and Node.js
- We recommend *Electives* to people that are more experienced and up for a challenge.
- For most of the topics at Node Interactive a workshopper is available. If you're interested in the complete list, visit the website.
